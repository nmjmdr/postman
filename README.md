# Postman
Sends emails reliably (supports failover) using services such as Sendgrid and Mailgun  

### Screenshots:
#### Using sendgrid as primary and mailgun as secondry in circuit breaker.

### Design goals:

1. Reliablity
The service should be able to failover from one provider (say Sendgrid) to another provider (say Mailgun) if the either of the services are not available to deliver emails. 

2. Minimal data loss
In case there are issues with the providers it should not (ideally) lead to loss of any mails that are to be delivered

3. Configurable
It should be possible to plug in new providers or retire existing ones without impacting the availiblity of the system.

4. Scailiblity
It should be possible to horizontally scale the service by adding more instances.

5. Flexibity in deployment
It should be possible encapsuatle the core functionalities in such way that it if we required we can deploy the service on AWS, Google Cloud, in data centers.
A side effect of this goal, is that it should be possible to easily run and debug the application locally.

### Design
![Design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmjmdr/postman/master/screenshots/Design.png)

#### Core Idea
```
1. The code idea is to have a set of workers fetch mails that need to delivered and pass them the providers. 
2. In case the worker faces an issue sending the mail one provider (let us call it the primary), it needs to use an alternative (let us call it the secondary).
      2.a. If an error has occured recently in using a provider (say provider A), there is a very good probablity that it might continue to fail for the next few calls.
      2.b Thus it is essential for the worker to continue to use the provider that works currently. 
      2.c. It could try and see if the error (for provider A) is now resolved
      2.d If yes, it can move to using provider A
3. The workers can randomly select a provider as primary and other provider as secondary. This way there would be a good distribution of providers being used across workers.
```
#### Circuit Breaker
_Point 2 calls for the use of circuit breaker_. The solution includes a circuit breaker that can accomplish Point 2. It also includes a customizable functionality (injected as functions) to determine:
1. When the probe (an attempt to see if the error is now resolved) should be carried out
2. Determine if an encountered error is due to provider or something else (most commonly input errors)

The circuit breaker developed in this solution can be used as a library across other projects. It has been unit tested with an attempt to cover all the scenarios.

#### Queue
##### Queue should support `read` and `visiblity timeout`
One of the problems with above approach is this:
1. Assume a worker fetches an item from the queue. The item is deleted (dequeued).
2. The worker is unable to send the message

This results in the data loss which we are aiming to avoid. To overcome this the queue should support:
1. Ability to read from the queue without deleting the item, but at the same time the item not being availble for other workers.
2. We can treat `item read by a worker and not being available for other workers` as an item being "assigned" to a worker
3. We need an ability for this "assignment" to expire. (aka visiblity timeout)
4. An ability to move an "item" to a `dead-queue` after "n" trials by workers. This effectively takes cares of "poisoned messages" which have errors that cannot be recovered from.

##### Candidates for implementation of such a queue
1. AWS SQS is a natural choice as it supports all the features that we need "out of the box".
2. Redis Queue. Reference: https://redis.io/commands/rpoplpush Sub-section: _Pattern : Reliable queue_
3. In memory queue: This is to used ONLY on local machines for development and debugging. 

In a distributed scenario we would have to use AWS SQS or Redis Queue. _The important idea is that the solution encapsulates the queue in such way that any of implementations can be used (as long as they support the required features).

#### Workers:
Workers can be deployed as standalone processes or as serverless functions (Ex: AWS lambda).

##### Making sure workers are reliable
1. It is critical that the workers are fault tolerant and do not exit when it is attempting to send a email. Of course there is very little a worker can do when it is being shutdown forcibily. It can still attempt to try and finish the task in progress.
To accomplish this the project employes what is called as a "gaurd". 

###### Gaurd
A gaurd is like a critical section which the worker can use to keep track of things that are `in progress`. If things are in progress and the worker receives a SIGNINT, it can try and wait until things are finished.
I have not implemented this yet in the solution. This needs to be added.

###### Ledger - an attempt to prevent sending duplicate emails
Assume that there just before the worker posts a mail for delivery, it checks with a store to see if that mail has already been sent. The prescence of such a store would reduce of the occurance of sending duplciate mails (either because a worker died before deleting a mail (but after sending it), or there are duplciate messages on the queues (when the queue does not guarantee only once delivery).

Such a store needs to support atomic insert and lookup. It could get its data from '`proxy` that observes all the requests and responses from workers to providers.

This ledger could prevent (all though not all) cases of duplicate messages.

The ledger is currently implemented as a in-memory solution, but ideally is implemented using a datbase such as postgres.

###### What does worker `flow` look like?
1. Start the gaurd
2. Read from queue 
3. Has the ledger seen this mail? is that mail already marked as delivered? (Identified by id: unique flake id)
4. If yes, then delete the mail from the queue, return
5. If no, then send it (using the circuit breaker)
6. Mark the mail as sent in ledger. (This could be done by a proxy later on)
7. delete the email
8. End the gaurd

#### RESTFul API to queue the mails
We exponse the following RESTFul API to post messages for delivery:
```
POST: http://<server-url>/mail

Body:
content-type: application/json
content:

[
	{
		"to": [{"email": "narasimha.gm@gmail.com"}],
		"from": {"email": "postman.p@protonmail.com"},
		"subject": "hello there",
		"content": [ {
			"type": "text/plain",
			"value": "hello there, how are you doing?"
		}
		]
	}
]
```
The format supports multiple mails in a single request. The request is valdiated using a JSON validation libraray called strummer (https://www.npmjs.com/package/strummer).
Valdations are done against the following definition:
```
const MaxBatchSize = 10;
const MaxEmailsInTo = 100;

const email = new s.object({
  email: new s.email()
});

const content = new s.object({
  type: new s.enum({values: ['text/plain']}),
  value: s.string()
})

const mailMessage = new s.object({
  to: s.array({min: 1, max: MaxEmailsInTo, of: email}),
  from: email,
  cc: s.optional(s.array({min: 0, max: MaxEmailsInTo, of: email})),
  bcc: s.optional(s.array({min: 0, max: MaxEmailsInTo, of: email})),
  subject: s.string(),
  content: s.array({of: content})
});

const requestPayload = new s.array({min: 1, max: MaxBatchSize, of: mailMessage});
```

#### Deployment
The solution can be deployed over AWS, with SQS as the queues. Ledger stored in postgres (or redis). Workers could be deployed as lambda services.

---- Tracking of queued messages (queued on providers) - next step

### Topics to explore further:
1. Multi queues to scale the queue (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1209.pdf)
A single queue could be subject to contention when the workers tries to get the next mail to send. Instead we could maintain multiple queues to be able scale the solution.

2. Extending circuit breaker to monitor the health of worker
Is the worker consuming messages at a lot lesser rate than the average (depending on the number of messages outstanding in the queue) 

4. Potential use of proxy to determine if a mail has already been sent
A proxy (Ex: nginix reverse proxy) could correlate requests and responses (do any of the providers support this?)
